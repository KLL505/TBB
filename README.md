# Think Better Bot
A personalized discord bot created for my personal discord server to help me and my friends study and solve problems. The bot uses the wolfram alpha API to answer questions, solve step by step math problems, hold conversations relating to a problem, and provide detailed information on given topics. It was built with typescript and uses functionality from the discord.js api, the wolfram alpha api, xml2js library, and the cross-fetch library.
